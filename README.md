Calculator in WF

I built this calculator and it runs the way I expected. However I wanted to make the window movable and I tried watching every related video from online, but I just couldn't get it. These codes for event handler for MouseMove is the one that makes the most sense to me, but it leads to more questions about some of the components of the codes.

So the questions I have are:
1. On line 128, e is from MouseEventArgs e. When I hover on MouseEventArgs e, it shows MouseEventArgs is a class,so why don't we need a new operator to create an instance for it before we can access it? Also, is X/Y the built-in variable name?
2. On line 136, is PointToScreen a method in Stucture Point? If it is, why don't we need "Point." in front of it? If not, what is it? Also, I couldn't understand the math logic here since I don't know what those points are...In my head I'm imaging the user gragging the X location of the upper left corner of the window from left to right, the X value will increase, same concept applies to Y. I really need help with understanding what the 2 pairs of X/Y values are!

Thank you so much!!
